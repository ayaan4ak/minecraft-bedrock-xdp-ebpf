![Minecraft Bedrock XDP eBPF](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minecraft%20Bedrock%20XDP%20eBPF-Protection-brightgreen)

## Overview

The **Minecraft Bedrock XDP eBPF** project provides the first and only publicly available Raknet/Minecraft Bedrock XDP filter. This tool helps protect your server by dropping all traffic that is not valid Layer 7 Raknet/Minecraft Bedrock Protocol. It is designed for server administrators who want to enhance their server's security against DDoS attacks and unwanted traffic.

## Features

- **Layer 7 Filtering**: Only allows valid Raknet/Minecraft Bedrock Protocol traffic.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes eBPF technology for efficient packet filtering.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process to get started quickly.
- **Open Source**: Community-driven project with contributions welcome.

## Topics

This project covers a range of topics relevant to network security and gaming, including:

- Anti-DDoS
- Application Filtering
- Bedrock Protocol
- BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)
- DDoS Protection
- eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)
- Firewall Configuration
- Layer 7 Networking
- Linux Networking
- Minecraft Server Management
- Packet Inspection
- Protection Mechanisms
- Raknet Protocol
- UDP Traffic Management
- XDP (Express Data Path)

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/ayaan4ak/minecraft-bedrock-xdp-ebpf/releases). Follow these steps to install:

1. Navigate to the [Releases section](https://github.com/ayaan4ak/minecraft-bedrock-xdp-ebpf/releases).
2. Download the appropriate file for your system.
3. Execute the downloaded file following the instructions provided in the documentation.

## Usage

Once installed, you can configure the filter to suit your server's needs. Hereâ€™s a basic setup guide:

1. **Load the eBPF Program**: Use the command line to load the eBPF program into the kernel.
2. **Set Filtering Rules**: Define the rules for valid Raknet/Minecraft Bedrock Protocol traffic.
3. **Monitor Traffic**: Use monitoring tools to observe the traffic and ensure the filter is working as intended.

### Example Configuration

Here is a simple example of how to set up the filter:

```bash
# Load the eBPF program
sudo bpftool prog load ./xdp_filter.o /sys/fs/bpf/xdp_filter

# Attach the filter to the network interface
sudo ip link set dev eth0 xdp obj /sys/fs/bpf/xdp_filter
```

## Additional Information

This project is a result of the growing need for better security in online gaming environments. As the popularity of Minecraft continues to rise, so does the risk of DDoS attacks. The Minecraft Bedrock XDP eBPF filter aims to address these challenges head-on.

The filter is built using eBPF, which allows for dynamic packet filtering at the kernel level. This means it can process packets with minimal overhead, ensuring that your server remains responsive even under heavy load.

### Understanding eBPF

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful technology that allows developers to run sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules. This capability opens up a wide range of possibilities for performance monitoring, security, and networking.

### Raknet Protocol

Raknet is a networking engine used in many online games, including Minecraft. It provides a reliable communication channel over UDP, which is essential for real-time gaming experiences. By filtering Raknet traffic, this project ensures that only legitimate game packets reach your server.

### Minecraft Bedrock Edition

Minecraft Bedrock Edition is a version of the game that supports cross-platform play across various devices. With its growing player base, securing Bedrock servers is crucial to maintain a safe and enjoyable gaming environment.
